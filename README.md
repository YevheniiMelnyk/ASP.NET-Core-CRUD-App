<h1>ASP.NET Core MVC Application</h1>
<p>This is an ASP.NET Core MVC application that allows users to view, edit and manage courses, groups, and students.</p>

<h3>Courses</h3>
<p>The default page of the application displays a list of courses. 
When a course is selected, the application displays a list of groups for the selected course.</p>

<h3>Groups</h3>
<p>When a group is selected, the application displays a list of students for the selected group. 
Users can also edit the group name using a separate form.</p>

<h3>Students</h3>
<p>Users can edit student names using a separate form. However, a group cannot be deleted if there is at least one student in the group.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p><i>The application is designed to help users manage their courses, groups, and students efficiently. It provides separate forms for editing group and student data, 
and ensures that data integrity is maintained by preventing the deletion of groups with students.</i></p>
